### What is it?

As robotics as a field expands, so does the demand for research around "softer" applications for robots. One of these areas is human-robot interaction, a blend of robotics and psychology. While working on one research project involving human response to robot simulated facial expressions, we were brainstorming ways to go about constructing a robot without certain knowledge about what the robot would be used for in the future after our relatively simple project was finished. As a result, we wanted to go for a more modular, easily-adaptible construction, and using [[site.projects.joynt]] was the perfect choice.

### What did I do?

As a mechanical team member, I worked on developing a custom version of Joynt to use in constructing the robot.
