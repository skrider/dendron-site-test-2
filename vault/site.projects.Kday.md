Kday is a web app built for handling payroll for small family businesses that I built over the course of my summer '21 internship with Zeal. I built Kday with a Typescript-based stack including React, Redux, styled-components, and React Final Form on the frontend, with an Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose backend. Unfortunately, I do not own the intellectual property to Kday so I cannot showcase it.
