After a couple months using Notion, I eventually realized that I was spending a non-trivial amount of time using my Notion when I should be actually getting meaningful work done. Focus is my end-all be-all task manager, the culmination of dozens of hours spent building Notion pages. It's super minimalist, but presents information in a dynamic, adaptive, satisfying way. The best system is the one you'll actually use - but not too much.
