### What is it?

Joynt is a modular, 3D printable build system that I designed myself. It has a simple but versatile construction of 3D-printable plates clamping around aluminum rods. 

After years in competitive high-school robotics, I decided that there had to be a better way to construct a robot besides labor-intensive custom fabrication or cost-intensive pre-bought kits. I set out on a journey to create a system that makers can use to construct robots and other mechanical devices with nothing more than a 3D printer and a set of hand tools.

### Where is it?

I am still working on it. With any modular system like Joynt, there is pretty much infinite room for improvement!

### What did I do?

So far I have been working alone on developing the idea, design, and fabrication of Joynt.
