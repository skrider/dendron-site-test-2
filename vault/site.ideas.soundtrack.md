>It's not a playlist, it's a soundtrack.

About a month ago, I realized that I was waking up too late, forgetting to eat breakfast, taking too long to exercise, and finishing my shower at least 20 minutes after I started. My solution? American Pie.

I set an alarm on my phone to play American Pie when I wake up (If you've seen Patriot on amazon prime, that's why). I task myself to get out of bed, do 25 push-ups, and whip up a tasty shake of [Huel](https://huel.com/) all before the song ends. 

Then, after exercising, I shower to a playlist made up of a handful of **2-minute songs** from significantly different genres. This way, I have a **really good idea of time's passage** - instead of turning on the water, getting in for what feels like just a minute, and then somehow realizing 15 minutes have passed and I have yet to unstop the bottle of shampoo, I can now tell how long I've been daydreaming just by what song is playing.

What did I learn? Music has definite potential to help me stay on-track to a certain goal or objective. By unconsciously associating a certain song with a certain task or state of mind, I can use it to automate parts of my day. Beyond that, listening to music makes just about anything more enjoyable!

### The Idea

Automatically stream Spotify music and play audio cues and snippets subject to user-defined patterns and constraints.

What one soundtrack might look like: 
1. Play individual song: American Pie
2. Pull from subset: play songs randomly from Spotify's Power Workout playlist for 1 hour
3. Play specific playlist: play "shower" playlist
4. Play from keyword subject to constraint: play "white noise" tracks for 15 minutes (for meditation) with as few breaks as possible
5. Audio reminder: use text-to-speech to say "check email" or something like that
6. Repeating Sequence
    1. Play 45 minutes of EDM, pulled from a certain playlist
    2. Play nothing for 10 minutes
    3. Repeat sequence 5 times
    4. Audio reminder: "Drink Water" (yes, I need a reminder to drink water)
7. User interrupt: Instead of EDM play rock now
8. Relinquish control of Spotify account 
9. Audio reminder: "Standup Meeting" 8:00pm
10. Play individual song: Truman Sleeps (bedtime) 1:00am

### Core Components

* Easy to create, share, and modify templates
* Easy to modify music stream and add reminders on-the-fly
* Super-minimal UI enabling soundtracks to be assembled quickly and intuitively (Most UI's are rectangular, so it's hard to use arrow keys with them. I want to try a radial UI. Think Overwatch emote menu)
* Pause / buffer / modify / switch stream with or without waterfall effects on later tracks and reminders
    * Potentially break stream up into sub-streams, a la video editing software
    * This would enable tracks to be overlaid. Could be good, could be bad.
