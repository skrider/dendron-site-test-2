### What is it?

A web app enabling meetings to be scheduled much more easily. Basically When2Meet with a modern UI, and features like GCal sync. Also incorporates a dashboard to track meeting responses.

### Where is it?

### What did I do?

As a technical co-founder, I worked on frontend development using Typescript and React.js, as well as the product vision.

### What ended up happening?

Original plans were to fuel organic growth with the meeting scheduling functionality, then scale up to a more comprehensive feature-set like that detailed in my \[\[Hyperdeck|site.ideas.hyperdeck\]\] post. However, after reviewing our original business model, we determined that it was unsustainable and that the market was over-saturated. We decided to move on to the next project.
