Another frustrating thing that Notion lacks is automatically repeating dates. Come on, even GCal has that. I took it upon myself to add this functionality, and proceeded to spend way too many hours figuring out hack after hack to save literally 2 clicks every time I finish a repeating task. But hey, it was worth it. Additionally, I added several other features such as timeblocking and a navbar. Download link coming soon.
