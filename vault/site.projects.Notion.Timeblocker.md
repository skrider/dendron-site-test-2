Timeblocking is a popular thing to do. It helps you know exactly what you should be doing at any one point in the day, which helps avoid procrastination. As such, many task management and to do list apps come with timeblocking functionality. Except for Notion. I decided to figure out how to create timeblockers that seamlessly integrate with existing task workflows within Notion so that I could better plan out my day.
