Most of my friends know me as the tryhard frequently pontificating about the benefits of Notion. I'm practically an evangelist for Notion at this point. But something about the platform brings me satisfaction while using it. Over the course of upgrading and revising my Notion-centered productivity toolkit, I have cobbled together a few tricks, hacks, and strangely designed components that may be useful to other frequent users.

*I don't have public versions of all of these ready yet, but will eventually*
