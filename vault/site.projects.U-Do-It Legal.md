### What is it?

I am contracted as part of student org Web Dev at Berkeley to work on U-do-it Legal, an app dedicated to simplifying the legal process to individuals illiterate in legalese (most of us), specifically focusing on the "fun stuff" like divorces and restraining orders. In essence, U-do-it Legal walks a user step-by-step through the process of filling out the required forms for the accomplishment of some particular end, without them needing to "lawyer up".

### Where is it?

No current public build.

### What do I do?

I work on backend development using AWS and Mongo. This is my first backend project so I am learning quite a lot!
