I'm Stephen Krider, a freshman currently studying EECS and Business under UC Berkeley's [MET program](https://met.berkeley.edu/about/). I started out as a mechanical engineer, but fell in love with the purity of CS, and the power it gives one to construct systems limited only by imagination. I am currently now on my personal journey to becoming "real programmer".

### Interests

* Productivity Tools
* Robotics
* Low-Code systems
* Full stack web development

### What I'm currently working on:

* [[Text-To-Slides|site.projects.Text-To-Slides]] - a web app for converting markdown into a slideshow, intended for aiding in running efficient and productive meetings, while streamlining organizational information flow.
* [[Joynt|site.projects.joynt]] - a 3D-printable build system (think industrial LEGOs) for constructing medium-sized robots and mechanical systems, geared towards users new to CAD or mechanical design
* [[Focus|site.projects.Notion.Focus]] - a minimalist Notion setup, geared towards my needs but adaptible to others', that can make productive hours more data-driven, efficient, and satisfying
* [[Side Hustle Stack|site.projects.Side Hustle Stack]] - a site serving as a guide to people interested in freelance and gig work
* [[U-Do-It Legal|site.projects.U-Do-It Legal]] - a web app to help people illiterate in legalese fill out simple forms

### What I've recently wrapped up:

* Gitlet - built a simplified version of Git from scratch for Berkeley's CS 61B course.
* [[Kalenda|site.projects.Kalenda]] - a web app for streamlining meeting scheduling workflows at any scale
* [[Metrobot|site.projects.Metrobot]] - a modular, general-purpose robot built using my [[Joynt|site.projects.Joynt]] 3D-printable build system

### Idea Horizon

If I had a month to work on anything, here's what I would spend it on building:
* [[Soundtrack|site.ideas.soundtrack]] - an app that interfaces with Spotify to automatically generate you a music stream, fitting to certain time constraints, helping you automate your day.
