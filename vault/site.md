I'm Stephen Krider, currently working part-time as a Software Engineer at [Zeal](https://www.zeal.com/) while attending UC Berkeley as a sophomore, studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science as well as Business Administration. During as well as after college, I plan to pair my love for software architecture as well as an affinity for fast-paced working environments to go work in startups!
